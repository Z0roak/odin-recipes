          it is worth it. The standart recipe will give you about 4 servings.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate, chopped</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon grounded dried chipotle pepper</li>
          <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
          <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, chilled</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Bring a saucepan of water to simmer on low heat. Place chocolate, butter, 2 tablespoons
              of water, grounded chipotle pepper and salt in a heatproof bowl; 
              set bowl over the simmering water. When the butter melts, whisk the chocolate
              mixture gently until smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons of water and sugar in another heatproof bowl
              over the same pan of simmering water until egg yolk mixture is foamy 
              and hot to the touch, about 3 minutes. Pour hot egg mixture into warm 
              chocolate mixture, whisk until smooth, and set over a bowl of ice to chill.
              Whisk constantly until mixture has cooled to room temperature or slightly cooler.
          </li>
          <li>Pour 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon cold cream into a chilled metal bowl, whisk until
              cream holds soft peaks. Place about half the whipped cream into the cooled 
              chocolate mixture; gently fold the cream into the chocolate. Repeath with remaining
              half of whipped cream, folding gently until nearly all the streaks have dissapeared.
              Divide mousse into 4 6-ounce ramekins.
          </li>
          <li>Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours
              (up to overnight) before serving.
          </li>
      </ol>
