    <p>This awesome hot cocoa can be prepared in about 15 minutes total,
        with about 5 mins prep-time and 10 mins cooking-time.</p>
    <p>The standart recipe yields about 1 cup although this can easily
        be adjusted below.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 ounces dark chocolate (such as Moser Roth's 85% Dark Chocolate), or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until just before boiling, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
    <p>Add brown sugar and stir unti dissolved, about 1 minute.</p>
    <p>Stir dark chocolate into milk until melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
    <p>Remove saucepan from heat and stir cream and cinnamon into milk mixture.</p>
    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <p>For creamier cocoa, use more heavy cream. I also like to put 
        whipped cream at the bottom of the mug and pour the cocoa over it.</p>
